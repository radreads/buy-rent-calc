## Roadmap

### Step 1: Define Project Scope
1. Document all required features and design goals.
2. Select frameworks and technologies (listed above).

**Testing**: Verify feasibility of each feature with simple prototypes.

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
1. Install Cursor for coding.
2. Initialize a Next.js project:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app rent-vs-buy-calculator
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss chart.js jest cypress
   ```
4. Set up Git repository and configure `.env` for sensitive data.

**Testing**: Ensure a default Next.js app renders successfully.

### Step 3: Design the UI
1. Create reusable components:
   - Input form
   - Results display
   - Graph components
2. Style using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and modern aesthetics.

**Testing**:
- Use Storybook.js for component isolation and visual consistency.
- Verify responsiveness across devices.

### Step 4: Implement Core Functionality
1. Build input handling with React state and hooks.
2. Develop calculation logic directly in React components for simplicity.
3. Implement local storage for temporary scenario saving (Phase 1).
4. Add Supabase integration for persistent storage (Phase 2).

**Testing**:
- Write unit tests for calculation functions using Jest.
- Validate frontend functionality with manual testing.

### Step 5: Add Visualizations
1. Integrate Chart.js for interactive graphs:
   - Cost comparison (bar chart).
   - Break-even analysis (line graph).
   - Expense breakdown (pie chart).
2. Connect graphs to live data calculations.

**Testing**:
- Confirm charts render correctly with test data.
- Test interactivity (e.g., tooltips, data updates).

### Step 6: Build Advanced Features
1. Enable scenario comparison and save functionality using Supabase.
2. Integrate regional data via APIs (e.g., Zillow, Redfin).
3. Add personalized recommendations based on user input.

**Testing**:
- Test multiple scenarios for consistency.
- Verify API data accuracy and responsiveness.

### Step 7: Polish and Deploy
1. Add animations for smoother UX.
2. Deploy to Vercel or Netlify.
3. Optimize SEO and accessibility.

**Testing**:
- Conduct end-to-end tests with Cypress.
- Use Google Lighthouse for performance testing.

### Step 8: Launch and Iterate
1. Collect user feedback through beta testing.
2. Analyze user behavior with tools like Hotjar or Google Analytics.
3. Regularly update features based on user needs.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure individual functions work as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate interactions between components and backend.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real user flows to detect bugs.
- **Performance Tests**: Optimize load times and interactivity.
